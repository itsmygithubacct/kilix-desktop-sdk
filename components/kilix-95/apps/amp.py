"""kilix desktop — Media Player: kilix-amp (Winamp 2.x clone) in an XPane.

Unlike the games (which live in kilix tabs), the media player opens INSIDE
the desktop: an SDL2 app on a private X server, streamed into a kilix 95
window. First run clones and builds github.com/itsmygithubacct/kilix-amp
via the InstallerWindow; the layout/config it saves is kept private under
its install dir so it never fights the user's own kilix-amp setup.
